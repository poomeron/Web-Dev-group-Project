            <h2>Welcome to our UN Sustainability Goals Site</h2>
            <p id="page-para">
                This website was created as a group project to explore three of the United Nations Sustainable
                Development Goals: Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), Goal 13 (Climate Action), and
                Goal 15 (Life on Land). Our aim is to explain what these goals are, why they matter, and
                how everyday actions can contribute to a fairer, greener and more sustainable future.

                <h3>How to explore the site</h3>
                <p>
                    Use the navigation bar at the top of the page. On smaller screens, the hamburger menu
                    will open and close the navigation so you can quickly move between the Home page, the
                    Goals, the About page, the Newsletter form and the Team page. All pages share the same
                    layout and colour scheme so it feels like one unified experience.
